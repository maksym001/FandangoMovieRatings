# Investigating Fandago Movie Ratings #

It has been found that Fandago had a bug that inflated movie ratings on their site.

This project is to validate if the bug has been fixed and Fandago rating is representative of population (note this was not possible)

Revised goal after initial investigation: validate if Fandago rating system changed between years 2015 and 2016
